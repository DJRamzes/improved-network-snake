# improved-network-snake
This project is a logical extension of my simple network snake.

To install this project firstly you need to install ncurses and boost
libraries.

To compile these files you need to pass the -lpthread, -lboost_system
-lncurses and -DNCURSES_NOMACROS parameters, or you can just use the installer-script.
